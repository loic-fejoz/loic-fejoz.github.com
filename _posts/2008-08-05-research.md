## Research
*I am interested in Lock-free algorithms. I especially want to prove their correctness by using proof-assistant.*

At the beginning my project proposal was to apply well-known methods in my research team [MOSEL](http://www.loria.fr/equipes/mosel/) to lock-free algorithms. Those methods are B, TLA+ and model-checking. Those methods imply a top-down approach. So the idea was to develop new algorithms.

Since then I discovered a lot of algorithms and a lot of work on developing such algorithms. But proofs were very rare and none of them were written within a proof-assistant. Therefore, I want to justify lock-free algorithms by applying well-known methods, and in particular B and TLA+.

Note also that my work is supported by [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/) through its [European PhD Scholarship Programme](http://research.microsoft.com/ero/PhD/).

### Realisation
You can find [all files from my thesis](http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/fejoz-thesis/) at gforge.inria.fr

While not directly related to my subject, [DIXIT](http://www.loria.fr/equipes/mosel/research/dixit/) is an editor for predicate diagrams I wrote when I was working as a research engineer.

## Teaching
All teaching activities are given at [ENSEM](http://www.ensem.inpl-nancy.fr).

### 2006-2007
I gave 21 hours of TP to the first year students. I have also given 7h30 of TD and 27h of TP to the second year one. It is an equivalent of 43h30 of TD.
- TP Java
- TP Architecture des ordinateurs
- TD Architecture des ordinateurs

### 2007-2008
- Spécification et Vérification de Systèmes Réactifs (20h)
- Spécification et Vérification de Systèmes Réactifs Temps Réel (20h)
